# TV Shows
‚Äã
A simple application that allows user to log in, see list of TV shows and a TV show detail with a list of episodes. 
‚Äã
## Architecture
‚Äã
I decided to use MVVM+C pattern to separate business and navigation logic from view layer. 
‚Äã
### Coordinator 

 - takes care of all the navigation, including alert presentation
 - I usually use a library for Coordinator pattern implementation, but for this project I decided to make my own.
‚Äã
### View Model 

 - handles all the business logic, including API calls 
 - defined by a protocol containing variables and functions visible for the View Controller
 - uses observable LiveData to allow real-time view updates

### Data Provider

- generic API calls implementation is defined in ApiDataProvider
- Data Provider for each module is defined by an extension of ApiDataProvider conforming to specified protocol.

### View Controller

- just a dummy view that presents and updates content given by View Model 

## Dependencies 

Most of the libraries I chose for this app I use on daily basis. The main dependency manager is CocoaPods. However, I also use SPM because one library lacks CocoaPods support. 

### SnapKit

Writing AutoLayout constraints programmatically can be a pain sometimes, but SnapKit makes it easy and fun. 

### Alamofire

Well-known networking library.

### SwiftLint

Great tool for checking code style and conventions.

### PromiseKit

Promises are an ellegant way to handle asynchronous programming, mostly when dealing with API calls. 

### Kingfisher 

My favorite tool for downloading images with just one line of code.

### JVFloatLabeledTextField

UITextfield with a floating label and beautiful animation.

### ETBinding

Library for observing values and events.

### ETPersistentValue

Easy and convenient UserDefaults usage.

## Notes

- Despite recommendation, I decided not to use CodableAlamofire for response deserialization, because I found a lightweight solution that doesn't require another dependency.
- I had testability in mind while developing, but unfortunately didn't have enough time to write tests üôÅ
